A common requirement when using Alfresco to keep documents from several customers at the same time is to be able to hide customer specific info from another customers.
When you deploy content model, there are sometimes that you have document types specific to one customer, like "Customer A Document" and "Customer B Document".

In "Customer A Site", you will be able to show only the types you want, like "Customer A Document".
